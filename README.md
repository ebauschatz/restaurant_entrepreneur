## Restaurant Entrepreneur

This application simulates running a restaurant chain with multiple franchises. Orders can be placed at any franchise and all transactions will be recorded in a daily log.

Each order will be chosen by the user from a list of predetermined menu options. The log will record the order type, order cost, the franchise where the order was placed, and the running total dollar amount of daily sales across all franchises. The log is organized by the time of order placement and each entry is labelled with the running transaction number.
